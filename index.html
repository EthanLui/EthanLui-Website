        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre- Business</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ethan Lui, and I currently attend University of California, Riverside. 
        I was born in New York, in Cortlandt Manor, and I moved to California in 2008. 
        I currently live in Cypress, and I attended Los Alamitos High School.  During my highschool years,
        I was part of the tennis team for 2 years, and did many extracurricular activities.  Some activities that I did were going to tennis 
        lessons after school.  I also attended swimming classes during middle school to the beginning of high school.  During highschool, I
        was always high-achieving.  This lead time taking many AP classes, which made my high school education much more difficult, but allowed 
        me to learn much more.  Some professional experiences that I have had were some internships and jobs.  I have had an internship over the 
        summer at a financial company, assisting and watching to see how an individual financial advisor works and does their job.  This internship 
        was during the summer of 2019, and I was able to learn a lot about what certain jobs are like, and also give me a taste of some jobs. 
        This experience helps me decide what major that I would choose in college, allowing me to see whether I enjoyed the financial aspect of 
        business and the jobs that come with it.  I also have had many volunteering experiences, throughout my highschool and middle school.  
        I have volunteered to help people in the tenderloin district in San Francisco, through food handouts, or through general aid.  I also 
        have traveled overseas to assist in medical aid to the locals in the area, specifically dental services.  Lastly, I have volunteered 
        in helping to paint a school in Compton, California.  Some job experiences that I have had were working for my parents in their store. 
        My role in this job was to assist where help was needed, handling the financials of the store, applying for licenses for expansion, 
        and generally helping around.  I decided to go to University of California, Riverside because I decided that it was the best school
        that I got accepted into that was decently close to home, but also far enough that I would get a college experience.  The school
        that I am attending is also far enough from home, to where I would have to dorm in the school or rent an apartment close by, as
        I am unable to commute.  This fact would give me a sense of independence from my parents, as I would be living by myself.  I
        decided to choose the pre-business major because I have always been interested in the field of business, and also my father
        worked in the field in the past.  When I have to choose a concentration next year, when i get into the school of business, I will
         choose either accounting or finance, as those topics interest me, however I will need to take the introduction classes for those
         concentrations to see whether I enjoy the subject and the classes that they are about.
